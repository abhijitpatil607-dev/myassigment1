**6.) Explain Client Server Communication ?**

**Ans.)** Client-server communication is how devices exchange data on a network, especially over the internet.

**How It Works:**



**Client Sends a Request:**

The client (like a web browser or app) asks for something — e.g., a webpage, file, or data.

This request is sent over the internet to the server.



**Server Processes the Request:**

The server is a powerful computer that listens for requests.

It processes the request, fetches the needed information, and prepares a response.



**Server Sends a Response:**

The server sends the data back to the client (e.g., HTML page, image, or result).



**Client Displays or Uses the Data:**

The client receives the response and shows it to the user or uses it in the application.
